## thinApp

The task here was to create a lightweight app, the thinnest possible, that responded to http requests using Express.  I used the following process and technologies:
1. Set up new npm package
2. Install Express
3. Create app.js
4. In app.js,
    * create an Express application
    * Define a route
    * Instruct the app listen on a given port
5. Navigate to root directory of the project, `node app`
6. In browser or Postman, make a get request to localhost:5000
